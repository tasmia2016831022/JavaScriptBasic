// CODING CHALLENGE

/*
Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two town elements:
1. Parks
2. Streets
It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name and a build year.
At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:
1. Tree density of each park in the town (forumla: number of trees/park area)
2. Average age of each town's park (forumla: sum of all ages/number of parks)
3. The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees
4. Total and average length of the town's streets
5. Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. If the size is unknown, the default is normal
All the report data should be printed to the console.
HINT: Use some of the ES6 features: classes, subclasses, template strings, default parameters, maps, arrow functions, destructuring, etc.
